# Rock-Paper-Scissors

A simple game where the player plays against the computer. To be able to play, the player first needs to click on the **START** button and confirm whether to start the game by typing **_yes/y_** and then input the **_number of rounds_** to play. There will be 3 buttons: **rock**, **paper**, **scissors**. After the game has been initialized, the buttons will be clickable (If the game has not been initialized, meaning if the **START** button has not been clicked and the player has not confirm to start the game and the number of rounds, clicking the 3 buttons mentioned will do nothing).

The same goes for the **RESTART** button.

At the end of the game, the player will need to click the **RESTART** button to start a new game or if wants to restart the game.

# NOTE

Once the game has been initialized, clicking the **START** button again will display a message and prevent the player from starting the game again as it's already running. Meaning if you want to restart the game, you will need to click the **RESTART** button instead.
